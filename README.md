<p>
Simple binary image classifier is a Machine-Learning approch with the purpose of classification is either be a yes/no decision so-called binary classification where a given item is predicted as class 0 or class 1, or several classes referring to multi-class classification.

### Steps performed
1. Raw data collection
2. data-preprocessing and segmantaion
3. Model preprocessing
4. Training
5. Prediction

In this project I implemented simple binary classification over  200 image data-sets collected from google images.


# Training 
The training includes minimization of cost function by continuous iterations over datasets while performing Gradient decent in each step and minimizaing parameters to fit the training sets.
